    <p>In 2016, during my middle school days, I embarked on a journey of curiosity and discovery, tinkering with DIY drones, 3D printers, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. This adventurous beginning served as a gateway, immersing me deeply into the realms of programming and web development. As I transitioned from hardware to the digital realm, I cultivated an affinity for both frontend and backend development.</p>

    <p>Today, I'm a final year student in a Master of Science in Computer Science, but I've already made my first professional foray during a six-month internship with Grytics. There, I not only honed my programming skills but also got the first taste of the professional tech world.</p>
        
    <p>Despite my busy academic schedule, I make it a point to nurture my love for DIY activities. My ventures range from creating unique 3D printer projects to maneuvering FPV drones - a testament to my enduring fondness for the blend of creativity and technology.</p>

    <p>Away from the screens and circuits, I'm an active individual with a keen interest in calisthenics and hiking. The thrill of a new trail or the satisfaction of a well-executed workout keeps me grounded and invigorated. Simultaneously, I'm continually broadening my horizons by delving into the world of film culture and graphic design, a hobby that adds a splash of artistic inspiration to my technically-oriented mindset.</p>

    <p>When I reflect on my journey so far, I realize it's the perfect blend of code, creativity, and outdoor adventures that keeps me excited about each day ahead.</p>
